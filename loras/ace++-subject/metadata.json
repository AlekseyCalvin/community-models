  "note": "[ACE++](https://huggingface.co/ali-vilab/ACE_Plus) is a effective transfer method that fine-tunes FLUX.1 Fill [dev] model. The reference image is placed on the left, while the right side is either the image to edit or left blank. The model uses the left-side reference image during generation. This LoRA enables the transfer of a subject (such as a logo) to a new image."
